Also of note, bubbling under the Top 5 this weekend was the debut of Open Road’s After We Collided, which opened domestically at No. 8. The YA romance came out of the gate with $420,000 in 460 locations—good enough for a $913 per-screen average. Internationally, the film has added $45.6 million to date since its opening in September, bringing its worldwide cumulative total to $46 million.  In other box-office news, this past week saw three more high-profile future releases pushing their opening days back due to the ongoing coronavirus threat. Universal’s Candyman and Sony’s Ghostbusters: Afterlife will now bow in the summer of 2021, while MGM’s Legally Blonde 3 has been bumped until 2022.
